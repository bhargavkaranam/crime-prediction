Implemented
-Graph for Probability of multiple crimes happening in a given category
-Graph between number of categories and probability of n crimes happening 
-We notice that 1, 2 and >=3 - three separate graphs

@Todo
Additional clustering based on timestamp, time of day (more accuracy in prediction)
Mine data according to holidays / working days
Generate graphs based on holidays / working days and find peak times
Generate economic crimes / normal crimes
Prediction based on latitude and longitude - 
->Log odds of a particular latitude and longitude appearing in a data set
->Log odds of a particular crime happening at that latitude and longitude
Heat map generation
